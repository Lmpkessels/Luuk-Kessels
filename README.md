### Hello, reader!

I'm Luuk Kessels,

Nice to meet you!

### 🙋🏻 About me... 

I'm 25 years old, born on 23-02-2000 in a town called Stramproy,
Based in the Netherlands.

I've been coding for 137+ hours, so there is much to learn.

My skills are 🐍 Python.
Persuasion is also something I'm familiar with.

I engage in 🥊 Kickboxing and 🏋🏻‍♀️ weight-training.

In the past, I've been welding for 7 years,
and quit school when I was 17 because I wanted to work.

“Education is what remains after one has forgotten what one has learned in school,
Albert Einstein said..."

I had my first job when I was 11, cleaning the parking space at my local supermarket.

My goal is to build a SaaS and help millions of people.

So,

If you read till here, thanks for reading.

It's been a pleasure to meet you.

Kind regards,
Luuk Kessels.
