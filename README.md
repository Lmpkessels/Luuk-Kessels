### Hello, reader!

About myself...

I'm Luuk Kessels, 

Nice to meet you!

I'm 25 years old and was born on,
23-02-2000 in a little farmers town called Stramproy,
Based in the Netherlands.

I've been coding for 137+ hours, so there is much to learn.

My skills are basic 🐍 Python.
Persuasion is also something I'm familiar with.

I engage in 🥊 Kickboxing and 🏋🏻‍♀️ weight-training.

In the past, I've been a welder for 7 year,
and have no formal schooling because I wanted to work.

I had my first job when I was 11.

If you read till here, thanks for reading.

It's been a pleasure to meet.

Kind regards,
Luuk Kessels.
